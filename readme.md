# ThaiConstituions
## manifesto
This repo's goal is to retrieve every single version of The Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand, both in Thai and in English, into an easy-to-access digital form. 

The project meant to radically open to collaborators who have access to all existing data and also help to transfer all the text into form that allows as open accessibility as possible. So please feel free to ask for collaborator access on github or email me at firmread@me.com. 

### A rough starting point.
